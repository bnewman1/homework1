        <p class="course_description">
          This course will introduce students to the traditional Graham, Dodd, and Buffett value investing framework as it has evolved over time (Fundamental VI) and the quantitative value investing framework (Quant VI). We will discuss the methods used for identifying and evaluating potential investment opportunities taking into account the fact that for every security you buy or sell, there is another investor in the market who is taking the opposite position and you could be wrong.

        <li><a href="https://www4.kellogg.northwestern.edu/CourseCatalogSchedule/CourseDetail.aspx?CourseID=206384">FINC-940-30</a>: Financial Modeling</li>
        <p class="course_description">
          This course, which builds on the foundational skills of analyzing and forecasting parts of a business, teaches students how to weave their forecasts into coherent spreadsheet-based, pro-forma financials. The course starts with conceptual examples that explain linkages between the three core financial statements (IS/BS/CF), it then builds on these examples to forecast the financial statements of real companies. The main goal of this course is to illustrate how a practitioner would analyze a leveraged buyout. Students will construct their own LBO model in Excel and, by the end of the course, should feel comfortable assessing a company and determining if it is a viable LBO candidate.

        <li><a href="https://www4.kellogg.northwestern.edu/CourseCatalogSchedule/CourseDetail.aspx?CourseID=204872">FINC-442-76</a>: Financial Decisions</li>
        <p class="course_description">
          This course uses case studies to enhance the student's understanding of managerial financial decision making, specifically investment and financing decisions. Topics include short- and long-term financing, capital structure and dividend decisions, cost of capital, capital budgeting, firm valuation, financial and operational restructuring, and mergers and acquisitions. The course emphasizes the basic principles of corporate finance and is sufficiently general so as to be of interest to all students. The course provides students with the opportunity to apply the concepts and theories developed in other finance courses. At its most fundamental level, the course attempts to improve problem-solving skills: problem definition, gathering and organizing the relevant information, developing feasible alternative courses of action, evaluating alternative choices, and recommending and defending the best course of action.

        <p class="course_description">
          This short course is geared for non-programmers who will be founders of, employed in, or consulting to companies that are "tech-enabled". Building an understanding of not only the language of the modern web, but also the processes involved in programming projects is essential in all aspects of technology companies' strategy and general management. Students will learn how to build and deploy their own "static" website, gaining essential coding literacy and experience with modern tools and nomenclature. Students should expect to spend 6-8 hours a week on assignments.

        <p class="course_description">
          This course delves into the strategic issues faced by healthcare firms. We will use concepts from the core strategy course (STRT-431) as an organizing framework, and discuss where and why the healthcare sector deviates from the norm. For example, what is the role of competitive positioning when quality is so difficult to measure? How can you remain profitable if you compete against not-for-profits who don't face taxes?
